# Login Flow Issue

## Problem Statement
- Login form submits via AJAX
- Server returns `{"status":"success"}` and sets session variables
- When redirecting to index.php, session variables are lost
- User gets redirected back to login page

## Root Cause
The session is not persisting between the AJAX request and subsequent page load, suggesting:
1. Session data is not being written properly during AJAX request, or
2. Session data cannot be read during index.php load

## Changes Made
1. Added session_write_close() to:
   - verifyuser.php after setting session variables
   - login.php after test user login
   - index.php at end of script

2. Added consistent session configuration in init.php:
   - session.use_strict_mode = 1
   - session.use_cookies = 1
   - session.use_only_cookies = 1
   - session.cookie_httponly = 1
   - session.cookie_path = /
   - session.cookie_domain = ''

3. Added debug logging to track session state:
   - Session ID tracking
   - Session contents
   - Cookie information

## Next Steps
1. Test login and check error logs for:
   - Session ID consistency between requests
   - Session data presence after write_close
   - Cookie propagation between requests

2. If issue persists, verify:
   - PHP session directory permissions
   - Session garbage collection settings
   - Cookie domain/path settings match server config
